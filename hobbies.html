                <p>I am a video game enthusiast. I enjoy playing many types of games, from shooters like Call of Duty,
                    RPGs like
                    games like Fallout 4, to simulations like the Sims 4. Unfortunately with the combination of school,
                    learning new langaues on my own time and preparing to join the workforce soon, I am unable to play
                    on my
                    PS5 or Computer, my two main methods for gaming. But I do get to play from time to time when I
                    managed
                    to get all the things I need to do for school and not learning new things or looking for open
                    positions,
                    I game. ðŸ˜Š</p>
                <p>I also like learning new trending or established technologies or Programming langaues I discover
                    through my
                    joruney to obtaining an Bachelor's degree. Such as "playing" with Arduinos during my Embedded
                    Systems course
                    and develioping an interest in the hardware aspects of tech industry. Discovering frameworks or
                    libraies like
                    React for JavaScript, Pygames for Python, and sasss for css. Evem when I am not learning about new
                    programming
                    langaues or technologies, I enjoy trying to perfect my current understanding in the programming
                    languages I
                    know. Doing thinks like studying best practices, reconfigure existing code to make it optimized or
                    look neat,
                    or dig deeper into the programming langaues to find new functions or methods I have never heard of
                    before.</p>
