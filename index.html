                    and will be graduating in Spring 2024. UCR provdide me a challenging cirriculum that helped me
                    keeped me in engage in my studies and developed my interest in programming and computer science

                            Hello, I am Andrew ocegueda, a first generation University Student aspiring to be a Software
                            Engineer as a
                            long-term
                            career.

                        <h3>My Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            I found the field to be facinating since you are using abstract ideas to turn it to
                            something
                            tangible
                            and useful in the real world. I enjoy the challenges the Computer Science field has such as
                            Finite Automata,
                            data Structures and Algorithms, and Operating Systems. Not to mention programming, which I
                            find
                            myself
                            wanting
                            to learn more and more about it, even if it is not for a class. Maybe the reason I like
                            programming is
                            because
                            there many different ways to solve the same problem and how modular programming can be if
                            done
                            in a
                            systematic
                            and structured way.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Hardships</h3>
                        <p>
                            There have been some hiccups in my life such as
                            attending college for 6 years and trying to apply to internships late last year with no
                            sucess.
                            But I do not
                            let that keeping y head up high, as each failure or hurdle provide an opportunity for me to
                            learn and grow
                            as
                            a person. If there is one lesson that I would share with others in which is most likely very
                            appliciple to
                            others, is that life is very unpredictable and you may not get to your destination in the
                            time
                            you want, but
                            you will get there eventually.
